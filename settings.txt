# This is the settings file for Boop (https://github.com/transmutable/boop)

# This will effect how the Boop web 3D scene is lit and how it loads your model  

# Edit this file and then reload the page to see your changes



# 	`background-color` will color the pixels that are not covered by your model

background-color: #6666FF



#	`model-obj` sets the relative path to the OBJ file
#		like 'model/SomeModel.obj'
#	The MTL file must be in the same directory and have the same name
#		like 'model/SomeModel.mtl'

model-obj: model/Landscape.obj


#	`model-glb` sets the relative path to a single glTF binary file
#		like 'model/SomeModel.glb'

# model-glb: model/AllInclusiveSet.glb


# 	`model-translation` sets the x y z position of the model in meters
# x is left-right, y is up-down, and z is back-forward

model-translation: 0 0 -10


#	`ambient-light` sets the intensity (0 to 1) and hex color of the base lighting of each object

ambient-light: 0.2 #FFFFFF


#	An area light is a shape that emits light (use sparingly)
#	area-light: <shape> <location: x, y, z> <rotation: x ,y ,z> <color: r, g, b,> <size: w, h> <intensity> <name>
#	Only rectangular shape is currently supported

#	`directional-light` adds a light with intensity (0 to 1), a hex color
#	the last 3 numbers set the x y z direction of the light in degrees

directional-light: 0.7 #FFFFFF 0 -1 -1

#	`model-rotation` sets the x y z rotation of the model in degrees

model-rotation: 0 -90 0



# 	`model-scale` sets the x y z scale of the model in meters

model-scale: 3 3 3


# `camera-translation` sets the x y z position of the camera in meters 

camera-translation: 0 0 0


#	`camera-rotation` sets the x y z rotation of the camera in degrees
